# life-of-boids in C++

## Overview

life-of-boids is an application/software developped in C++ to simulate a flock of birds in animation mode in order to show their individual behaviour and interaction with each other and the environment surrounding them.

In general lines, the project corresponds to an artificial life experience which permits to analyse collective and individual behaviour, in addition to providing fun user interaction.


## Code Architecture

### The flock

The flock constitutes the ensemble of the environment, agents and interactions simulated by the program, in a way that only one flock can be generated and displayed to the user.

In technical terms, the flock is represented by a class, the highest class in the code hierarchy whose instantiated object will incorporate most of the other objects in the project. It hosts, for example, all of the birds and predators in the project.

The only attribute of this class is a vector of pointers to *Agents*. An Agent can be interpreted as a living being belonging to the flock, such as a bird or an eagle, which will interact with other agents around him. Thus, this vector points to the data representing the actual flock.

This vector can be modified according to user agents or user interaction by the methods of the class Flock. Therefore, the vector (representing the flock) can grow, when an agent is added, or can decrease in size, when an agent is removed. It methods also permits to access information of the flock, such as its size or specific agent.

### Agent

As already stated, an agent is an active member, a living being of the flock. It is represented in the code by a class that, when instantiated, will create the objects belonging to the Flock vector.

In practice, though, this class can never be instantiated, as it intends only to be a parent class for two other child classes:

- Bird
- Eagle

Which instantiated objects will then inherite or override the general properties and methods of an agent.

The agent, for example, has a position and velocity representing the values perceived by the user in the last time step. In order to compute the interactions between agents/user in the current time step, another position and velocity are also stored, according to its own speed limit. Other properties related to the interface are body size and color.

The interaction between agents occurs only if they are within a certain range and view angle (according to its own movement direction). All this properties can be different pursuant to the agent type - eagle or bird (and even type of bird). In addition, each child class has its own specific attributes and methods to determine its behaviour.

The attributes in the Agent class, are all *protected*, thus they can only be accessed from its own methods or from their child classes, but not from outside. In the last case, interface methods are provided to access and set such properties.

### Bird

The objects of this class will represent, intuitively, the birds of a flock. The instantiation of a Bird is done by a constructor which will simply call the *Agent constructor* with certain specific values. The position and velocity, for example, are randomly chosen within certain boundaries, whereas the size, range and view angle (270Â°) are set to constant values.

The bird's behaviour, on the other hand, is determined by a group of rules/laws represented and computed by private methods:

* Alignment law
* Cohesion law
* Separation law
* Fleeing law

Each of these will contribute to modify the computed speed of the bird, and therefore its position and direction of movement.

#### Alignment law

### Eagle

The objects of this class will, intuitively, represent eagles. Eagles are predators, and their role in the flock is to chase birds and eat them.

Similar to the class Bird, this one also calls the *Agent constructor*, although with different parameters like a smaller size and range, different color and narrower view angle.

The behaviour of an eagle is also different from a bird, and it is determined by only one law:

*  Hunting law

As in *Birds*, these laws will be computed and modify the position and velocity of the eagle.

#### Hunting law

This law is responsible for the predator chasing the birds. If there are bids in the eagle's view angle and range, a random prey is chosen to be the focus of the chase at each time step. This means that the predator's velocity will scale according to the prey's velocity - that is, the eagle will intersect the bird at its next position.

If the eagle gets close enough to its prey, it will *feed* from it; In programming terms, the object *Bird* will be destroyed from memory and the removed from the Flock vector, also disappearing from the graphical user interface. After feeding, the eagle grows in size, until a certain limit; overcoming this limit, the predator will divide itself - that is, return to its original size and create 2 other predators in the same position.
